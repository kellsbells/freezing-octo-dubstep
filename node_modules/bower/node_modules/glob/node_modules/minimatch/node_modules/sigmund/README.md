# sigmund

Quick and dirty signatures for Objects.

This is like a much faster `deepEquals` comparison, which returns a
string key suitable for caches and the like.

## Usage

```javascript
function doSomething (someObj) {
  var key = sigmund(someObj, maxDepth) // max depth defaults to 10
  var cached = cache.get(key)
  if (cached) return cached)

  var result = expensiveCalculation(someObj)
  cache.set(key, result)
  return result
}
```

The resulting key will be as unique and reproducible as calling
`JSON.stringify` or `util.inspect` on the object, but is much faster.
In order to achieve this speed, some differences are glossed over.
For example, the object `{0:'foo'}` will be treated identically to the
array `['foo']`.

Also, just as there is no way to summon the soul from the scribblings
of a cocain-addled psychoanalyst, there is no way to revive the object
from the signature string that sigmund gives you.  In fact, it's
barely even readable.

As with `sys.inspect` and `JSON.stringify`, larger objects wil
